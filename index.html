		<h1>Tourist Information Amsterdam</h1>

			galleries.Traditional art-lovers know the route to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. 
			But modern art too is richly represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and 
			the Cobra museum in Amstelveen to name just two. There is a plenty of galleries, 
			especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan. And if you want to experience more 
			of nature, then the gardens of the universities and Artis Zoo are the right addresses.

		<p>
			From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody the very spirit of 
			Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges, including the famous Magere Brug, 
			a traditionally stylled lift bridge. You can simply relax at a canalside caf√© and watch 
			an array of boats float by, or take a canal tour.
