second largest port - after Rotterdam. Amsterdam is at the centre of a part of

galleries.Traditional art-lovers know the route to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. 
But modern art too is richly represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and 
the Cobra museum in Amstelveen to name just two. There is a plenty of galleries, 
especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan. And if you want to experience more 
of nature, then the gardens of the universities and Artis Zoo are the right addresses. 
In a nutshell, there are lot of things to see in Amsterdam.  

Amsterdam Canals and Waterways 
From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody the very spirit of 
Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges, including the famous Magere Brug, 
a traditionally stylled lift bridge. You can simply relax at a canalside café and watch 
an array of boats float by, or take a canal tour.
